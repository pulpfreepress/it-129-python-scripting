# Multi-Threaded Vacation

When you go on vacation, it sure is nice to have people wait on you so you can relax. Exhausted from your last single-threaded vacation, you decide to book a stay at a Michiline 5-Star where they wait on you hand-and-foot.

Feeling thirsty? Place your order with the waiter, then sit back and wait for your ice-cold Mai Tai to arrive. 

Starving? Heck yeah, after all, you're on vacation and can't wait to try the Canard a l'Orange, but you don't want to lose your sweet ocean-side lounge chair. No problem! Ask the waiter and return to sipping your drink until your dinner arrives.

This program uses the Python [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) library's Thread class to hand off the chores of fetching drinks and fetching food. When you run the program, you'll see you end up doing a whole lot more relaxing.
