# JSON Operations
Introduction to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

## Used to Exchange Data Between Systems
- Key/Value Pairs (Sound familiar?)

## Challenging for Humans to Read
- But easier that XML

## The Python [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) Library
- Provides JSON Encoder (json.dumps) and Decoder (json.loads)
- Work with Python types (Dictionary, Lists, etc.)
    - And convert to and from JSON

## Use JSON to Returnh Data From Serveer
- Server converts data to JSON and send to client
- Client decodes JSON payload for processing
