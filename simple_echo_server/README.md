# Simple Echo Server

A multi-threaded client-server application implemented in Python. Server echos messages sent from client back to the client.

## To Run The Application

1. Launch a terminal window and start server on available `ip` address and `port`. Modify values if required on the server's main.py entry point file. 
2. Launch another terminal window and start a client. Ensure it's connecting to the same `ip` address and `port`
3. Use client to send messages to server. See the messages appear on the server's terminal window. 
4. Launch more clients and send messages to server from multiple clients. 
5. To quit a client application type `quit`
6. To shutdown the server type `shutdown server`
