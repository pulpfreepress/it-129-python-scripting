# Single-Threaded Vacation

Ever go on a vaction only to return home exhausted? This naive little program simulates going on vacation to a one-star hotel or a Motel 6, where you have to do everything yourself. 

All you want to do is relax. Feeling thirsty? You gotta get up and get your own drink. Feeling peckish? You gotta get up and fetch your own snack! It's be nice to have a waiter, but there are not to be found...after all, this is a one-star resort for a reason. You're saving some cash but you're not relaxing.
